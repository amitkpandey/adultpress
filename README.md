Wordpress customised for Adult Sites.

Everyone knows that Wordpress is the go-to CMS when creating a startup adult / porn site. It is debatable whether it is even an ideal choice for such a site, but many people use it as such time and time again. However setting up Wordpress for the job is exceptionally tedious and time consuming.

At [AdultStack](http://adultstack.com) we do this setup for clients continuously. Yet we had kept to doing a **"from scratch"** process because every client wanted something entirley different, but times are changing. Most startup adultwebmasters are now deciding on the same thing... *Get a basic membership site up and running at little to no cost as a temporary solution until the money starts rolling in.* This has evolved in to a very **"structured"** setup for Wordpress, however, it is time consuming and can be a lot of effort for a short term solution.

With this in mind we have decided to define a set structure for an adult website using Wordpress. In doing so we can automate the setup process defining commonly used Wordpress plugins and having them installed and activated straight after installation. We can also implement edits that are common to avoid the use of plugins to accomplish Wordpress **"hacks"**. This results in a bloated Wordpress installation that may include questionable code and unnecessary information provided by the plugin developer.

We will employ and customise already used solutions such as:
  * [Roots/bedrock](https://github.com/roots/bedrock)
  * [Roots/sage](https://github.com/roots/sage)
  * [Composer](https://github.com/composer/composer)

This project will be documented in the [wiki](https://github.com/AdultStack/adultpress/wiki).
